  # Before you buy


  There are quite a lot of things that are important to know before even looking at actual products. In this article, I will at least try to list all of the important info you need to know when starting out


  ## Fpv is expensive


  I feel like this is the most important thing to get out of the way. Having unrealistic price expectations that are then hard/impossible to achieve is the fastest way to get turned away. All the different prices are explained in the FAQ, but the main point is: 


  The minimal upfront cost to get a quad and all the equipment needed to get it in the air is about $300, and another $300 if you want to have something that will carry a full-size action camera like a GoPro. It could be cheaper, but most things that will take the price lower than that are usually not worth buying 


  ## Do your research


  As is with buying a car, a PC, a phone, or any other electronic device, you should know what you're buying, and what the basic names and terms mean. 


  Watch build guides (ideally not ones that are over 2 years old if you're looking for parts recommendations as well), setup tutorials, and reviews to get an idea of what you need/want to buy. If you're unsure about your findings, don't know what something means, or just want opinions, it's fine to ask. That leads us to... 


  ## Asking for help


  A good rule of thumb is that if it can't be found on Google in less than a minute, it's probably something worth asking others. There are many places where you can get help, be it forums, Reddit communities (r/fpv, r/multicopter), or Discord servers ([Mr Steele](https://discord.gg/fpv), [Drone Community](https://discord.gg/drones)). Before you ask, there are a few things that you should know: 


  1. Ask in the appropriate way and/or place - most forums/discord servers have dedicated places for specific questions. Putting your questions in the appropriate place will go a long way for the people that help out others

  2. There are no stupid questions - it's perfectly okay to not know something. Don't be afraid to ask, or worry that you're annoying others. It's better to just ask what you want rather than just going in blind and spending a lot of money on bad equipment

  3. There are good and bad ways to ask - First of all: https://dontasktoask.com/ is a great page to show how not to approach things. This basically means that you shouldn't ask

     > hey guys can anyone help me with something?

     Instead, when asking, you should go straight to the point. Explain what you want to know, what you've done/found out so far, and any other ideas that you may have
  4. On chat platforms like discord, don't mention (multiple) people unless it's specifically allowed. Don't send direct messages out to people who offer help, keep it in one place, and be patient if someone doesn't immediately respond. Someone will eventually see your questions, it's rude to be impatient (or even rude) to volunteer helpers 


  # Choosing what to buy


  Before you go invest your time, effort, and money into the hobby, making educated decisions goes a long way to prevent overspending/buying bad gear, and keeping your sanity


  ## Avoid untrusted products


  Sadly there are many manufacturers that make unreliable or even clone products. This is often hard to spot as a beginner. I will list some manufacturers/products below that shouldn't be considered unless specifically said otherwise: 


  * Eachine - with the exception of the EV800D goggles and some products that they only re-brand, most of their products are low in quality at best 

  * Racerstar - their electronics may be cheap, but they're extremely unreliable, often failing in highly destructive ways 

  * ZOP LiPo's - Mostly a brand sold on Banggood, their batteries have pretty much no quality control. Don't cheap out on stuff that can burn your house down

  * IMAX B6 chargers (and their various clones) - The original B6 charger is already known to be more or less a fire hazard. The clones are even worse in this aspect. If you see a charger that looks something like this, it's not worth it

    ![imax b6 charger (bad)](/uploads/4518_imax-b6-50w.jpg "imax b6 charger (bad)")
  * BetaFPV LiteRadio 2 - Might seem like a good budget option (and the LiteRadio 3 is actually acceptable), but the LiteRadio 2 has very bad gimbals that tend to fail within about a month of use


  I will finish this later
