  # Before you buy


  There are quite a lot of things that are important to know before even looking at actual products. In this article, I will at least try to list all of the important info you need to know when starting out


  ## Fpv is expensive


  I feel like this is the most important thing to get out of the way. Having unrealistic price expectations that are then hard/impossible to achieve is the fastest way to get turned away. All the different prices are explained in the FAQ, but the main point is: 


  The minimal upfront cost to get a quad and all the equipment needed to get it in the air is about $300, and another $300 if you want to have something that will carry a full-size action camera like a GoPro. It could be cheaper, but most things that will take the price lower than that are usually not worth buying 


  ## Do your research


  As is with buying a car, a PC, a phone, or any other electronic device, you should know what you're buying, and what the basic names and terms mean. 


  Watch build guides (ideally not ones that are over 2 years old if you're looking for parts recommendations as well), setup tutorials, and reviews to get an idea of what you need/want to buy. If you're unsure about your findings, don't know what something means, or just want opinions, it's fine to ask. That leads us to... 


  ## Asking for help


  A good rule of thumb is that if it can't be found on Google in less than a minute, it's probably something worth asking others. There are many places where you can get help, be it forums, Reddit communities (r/fpv, r/multicopter), or Discord servers ([Mr Steele](https://discord.gg/fpv), [Drone Community](https://discord.gg/drones)). Before you ask, there are a few things that you should know: 


  1. Ask in the appropriate way and/or place - most forums/discord servers have dedicated places for specific questions. Putting your questions in the appropriate place will go a long way for the people that help out others

  2. There are no stupid questions - it's perfectly okay to not know something. Don't be afraid to ask, or worry that you're annoying others. It's better to just ask what you want rather than just going in blind and spending a lot of money on bad equipment

  3. There are good and bad ways to ask - First of all: https://dontasktoask.com/ is a great page to show how not to approach things. This basically means that you shouldn't ask

     > hey guys can anyone help me with something?

     Instead, when asking, you should go straight to the point. Explain what you want to know, what you've done/found out so far, and any other ideas that you may have
  4. On chat platforms like discord, don't mention (multiple) people unless it's specifically allowed. Don't send direct messages out to people who offer help, keep it in one place, and be patient if someone doesn't immediately respond. Someone will eventually see your questions, it's rude to be impatient (or even rude) to volunteer helpers 


  # Choosing what to buy


  Before you go invest your time, effort, and money into the hobby, making educated decisions goes a long way to prevent overspending/buying bad gear, and keeping your sanity


  ## Avoid bad products


  Sadly there are many manufacturers that make unreliable or even clone products. This is often hard to spot as a beginner. I will list some manufacturers/products below that shouldn't be considered unless specifically said otherwise: 

  * Eachine - with the exception of the EV800D goggles and some products that they only re-brand, most of their products are low in quality at best 

  * Racerstar - their electronics may be cheap, but they're extremely unreliable, often failing in highly destructive ways 

  * ZOP LiPo's - Mostly a brand sold on Banggood, their batteries have pretty much no quality control. Don't cheap out on stuff that can burn your house down

  * IMAX B6 chargers (and their various clones) - The original B6 charger is already known to be more or less a fire hazard. The clones are even worse in this aspect. If you see a charger that looks something like this, it's not worth it

    ![imax b6 charger (bad)](/uploads/4518_imax-b6-50w.jpg "imax b6 charger (bad)")
  * BetaFPV LiteRadio 2 - Might seem like a good budget option (and the LiteRadio 3 is actually acceptable), but the LiteRadio 2 has very bad gimbals that tend to fail within about a month of use


  Those are just a few off the top of my head, if you're unsure about something, it's **always** better to ask

  ## Get good products

  I wouldn't want to tell you what *not* to get and then just stop there. FPV is not all just caution about products, there are manufacturers that have a very clean track record

  * Radiomaster - Their TX16S radio is arguably the best radio on the market, and their products are generally very good. They also have a very good reputation for customer support

  * Rush - Great VTXs and stacks, can't really go wrong with them

  * Happymodel - Known for micro quads, and likely the original widely-used ELRS hardware which they still continue to improve

  * Diatone - A whole ton of great products, from frames, stacks to motors. Wide range of price points all with good quality

  * IFlight - Great frames, motors, ESCs, and flight controllers. Their electronics are good, but they're a bit more expensive than other options

  * TMotor - Great motors, and their ESCs are also very good. They're a bit more expensive than other options, but they're mostly all worth it

  There are many more manufacturers that make good products, but these are the ones that I've had the most experience with. If you any suggestions, feel free to let me know or make a pull request on the GitHub repo

  ## What to actually buy

  Now that you know what to avoid and what to get, it's time to actually buy stuff. I will try to list the most important things that you need to get started, and then go into more detail about the different parts. Most of this info is also in the [FAQ](https://vitroidfpv-sv.netlify.app/faq#Building), but I will try to explain it in a short and concise way here, as well as some specific product recommendations

  1. A radio - The first thing you should buy when starting FPV is a good radio. It will allow you to get in some sim time while waiting for the rest of your gear, and most modern ones do not require any additional things to run, except batteries. I would absolutely go with ELRS if possible, all of the radios listed below have ELRS versions

      * Radiomaster Zorro - Small, gamepad style radio
      * Radiomaster TX12 MK II - Small radio with a more traditional shape
      * Radiomaster TX16S MK II - The best radio on the market, if you can afford it, get it

  2. The quad itself - Depending on if it is a pre-built or not, it may take you a week or more to get all the parts, build it and set it up. This mostly applies for self-built quads, but even pre-builts will take some setup time

      * Happymodel Mobula 6/7 - The best micro quad on the market, great cheap option for flying indoors and lightly outdoors as well

      * Happymodel Crux 3 - A good 1s toothpick, great for flying outdoors in your backyard or at a park

      * DarwinFPV Babyape V2 Pro - Pretty much the cheapest quad that you can get that is actually good. It runs on 3s, so you will need a proper charger for it, unlike the other two that can use a simple 1s one

      * HGLRC Petrel 120X (Specifically the 4s version) - If you're looking for something with a lot of power at this smaller size, this is a great pick. But it is more expensive than the other options, and also needs a proper charger

      * Self-built micro quad - If you're looking for something that you can build yourself, I have a [guide](https://vitroidfpv-sv.netlify.app/building) on how to build one. It's a bit more expensive than the pre-built options, but you can customize it to your liking and it will teach you a lot about how quads work and go together

      * IFlight Nazgul 5 V2/Evoque - Moving up to full-size 5" quads, these are great options. The Nazgul 5 V2 is cheaper, the Evoque is newer, but more expensive. Both are good entry-level quads that can haul a full-size GoPro

      * Self-built 5" quad - I have build guides for 5" quads as well, currently a Beginner, Advanced, or a Race build, you can find them [here](https://vitroidfpv-sv.netlify.app/building)

  3. Tools, spare parts, and other accessories - You will need [tools](https://vitroidfpv-sv.netlify.app/faq#tools) to build, maintain, and fix up your quad, and some [spare parts and other odd bits](https://vitroidfpv-sv.netlify.app/faq#accessories) to replace broken ones if needed

  3. Batteries and a charger - You can't fly without batteries, and you can't charge them without a charger. They're not esential to the setup, but you will need them to actually fly and set up the ESC
  
      * [Pretend that I have a list of batteries and chargers, or a link to the equipment page]

  4. Goggles - You can fly without goggles, but it's usually a lot harder. You can build and set up the quad while waiting for your goggles to arrive, and that leaves you with a lot less steps of setup to do when you get them

      * Eachine EV800D - The best budget option, and the one I recommend to most people. They're not the best, but they're good enough for most people that are just starting out

      * Skyzone Cobra S/X - The best box goggles on the market, but they're also the most expensive in this category

      * Skyzone Sky 02o - Cheapest that you can get slimline goggles, but they have pretty low FOV which may be a problem for some people

      * Eachine EV300o - Pretty much just a re-branded pair of Skyzone goggles that are pretty similar to the following 04L/X

      * Skyzone Sky 04L/X - The best slimline goggles on the market, but they're also the most expensive in this category. The 04L use slightly worse screens, but are cheaper
