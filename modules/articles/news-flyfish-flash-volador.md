  So... let's start off with some background. FlyFish is a very new FPV
  manufacturer, owned and ran by multiple different people from the FPV
  industry, including IFlight


  The products they make (currently motors, antennas, and frames) are pretty good from everything I heard. A lot of amazing pilots that I know really like the motors, and had direct feedback when it came to making them. The antennas seem to be pretty average but not bad, and we can never have enough. Their frames are currently the newest options in their lineup, but similar to the motors, they are well-made and truly tested


  # Flash motors


  Coming in two color options, black & silver, and silver & purple. IMO a really nice niche to hit, both for people looking for stealth motors, as well as people looking to add a pop of color. Color variations of the silver ones are also planned, for blue and gold as the accents


  They also offer replacement bells for every motor they sell, so you don't have to pay the full price if you just damage the bell. Though this is pretty unlikely, as they are pretty durable and run smoothly even after heavy crashes from what I heard.

  # Volador frames


  Slick aluminum-on-carbon frames with fancy colors, reasonable pricing, 3d milled carbon, and integrated XT60 holders


  ## Volador VX5/VD5


  Not your typical boxy frames, they have full 7075 aluminum cam cages for a really nice look and all-round camera protection, and durable T700 carbon. Coming in a Squash-X and Deadcat configurations for freestyle and cinematic uses. Heavier than usual, but with the thick carbon plates and 6mm arms that are extra thick in the center, it makes sense


  Available options:


  * [Volador VX5](https://www.flyfish-rc.com/collections/frames/products/volador-vx5-fpv-freestyle-t700-frame-kit) Black/Tropical Mix

  * [Volador VD5](https://www.flyfish-rc.com/collections/frames/products/volador-vd5-deadcat-fpv-lr-t700-frame-kit) Black/Tropical Mix


  Specs:


  * 7075 Aluminum and T700 Carbon:

    * 6mm arms
    * 2.5mm top plate
    * 3mm middle plate
    * 3mm bottom plate
  * 19/20mm camera mounts (Micro/DJI)

  * up to 5.1" props

  * 225mm wheelbase

  * 199.5g VX5, 203.5g VD5 (with all of the TPU parts)

  * $64.90 for black TPU, $69.90 (nice) for the multicolor "Tropical mix" TPU

  * (The Tropical mix TPU looks really nice, I'd pay extra for that)


  ## Volador VX6/VD6


  Very similar in principle to the 5" frames, but with longer 6" arms for mid-range shots, and/or for comfortably carrying slightly heavier cameras (think heavy GoPro 10/11). Could also use 5.5" props as a nice in-between, as the extra 1" of the arms does not add much weight


  Available options:


  * [Volador VX6](https://www.flyfish-rc.com/collections/frames/products/volador-vx6-fpv-freestyle-t700-frame-kit) Black/Tropical Mix

  * [Volador VD6](https://www.flyfish-rc.com/collections/frames/products/volador-vd6-deadcat-fpv-lr-t700-frame-kit) Black/Tropical Mix


  Specs:


  * 7075 Aluminum and T700 Carbon:

    * 6mm arms
    * 2.5mm top plate
    * 3mm middle plate
    * 3mm bottom plate
  * 19/20mm camera mounts (Micro/DJI)

  * up to 6.1" props

  * 268mm wheelbase

  * 211.1g VX6, 203.5g VD5 (with all of the TPU parts)

  * $69.90 (nice) for black TPU, $74.90 for the multicolor "Tropical mix" TPU

  # Osprey antennas


  I mean they're antennas, not much to write about. I've asked around, and the omnis seem pretty durable. They come in multiple different lengths, sizes, polarizations and connectors for all of the different ways you'd want to mount them. They also have a DJI faceplate directional antenna for DJI FPV Goggles V1 and V2. All of their antennas are available [here](https://www.flyfish-rc.com/collections/antennas/fpv-antennas)
