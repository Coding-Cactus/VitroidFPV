  So... let's start off with some background. FlyFish is a very new FPV
  manufacturer, supposedly started by two ex-employees from IFlight and multiple
  others from the FPV business


  The products they make (currently motors, antennas, and frames) are pretty good from everything I heard. A lot of amazing pilots that I know really like the motors, and had direct feedback when it came to making them. The antennas seem to be pretty average but not bad, and we can never have enough. Their frames are currently the newest options in their lineup, but similar to the motors, they are well-made and truly tested


  # Flash motors


  Coming in two color options, black & silver, and silver & purple. IMO a really nice niche to hit, both for people looking for stealth motors, as well as people looking to add a pop of color. Color variations of the silver ones are also planned, for blue and gold as the accents


  They also offer replacement bells for every motor they sell, so you don't have to pay the full price if you just damage the bell

  # Volador frames


  Slick aluminum-on-carbon frames with fancy colors, reasonable pricing, 3d milled carbon, and integrated XT60 holders


  ## Volador VX5/VD5


  Not your typical boxy frames, they have full 7075 aluminum cam cages for a really nice look and all-round camera protection, and durable T700 carbon. Coming in a Squash-X and Deadcat configurations for freestyle and cinematic uses. Heavier than usual, but with the thick carbon plates and 6mm arms make sense
