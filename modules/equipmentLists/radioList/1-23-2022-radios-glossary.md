  # Info:


  There's just a lot of *stuff* to be written about every radio, and not much room to put it while keeping the product listing concise. So I'll put everything here that wouldn't go elsewhere


  ### Protocol:


  I go into more detail into the actual protocol compatibility between receivers and transmitters [in the FAQ](https://vitroidfpv-sv.netlify.app/faq#compatibleRadio). But it's slightly different here. For the most part, I listed the actual RF tech used in the radios


  * CC2500 - The main chip used in FrSky radios, used for ACCST transmission, along with other minor protocols

  * 4in1 - A collection of the 4 chips used in nearly all 2.4GHz Radio controllers, basically allowing you to bind it to pretty much anything, including toys, and non-quadcopter-related receivers, such as FrSky, FlySky, Spektrum and variations thereof, Futaba, and a [lot more](https://www.multi-module.org/basics/supported-protocols)

  * ELRS - Also in more detail in the FAQ, it's an open-source, long-range, high-performance link, and IMO the best option going forward if you don't have any other RC gear


  ### Gimbals:


  Refers to the sensor type used to get the angle of the stick, we mainly see these two used:


  * Pot - Potentiometer, relies on physical contact between the measurement surfaces to measure electrical resistance, thus susceptible to wear and at times more physical movement resistance

  * Hall - Hall Effect sensor, uses magnetic fields to get the rotation. It should practically last forever, won't wear out, and won't obstruct movement


  ### Module bays:


  The slot in the back of the radio where you can install an external transmitter module. To get higher output power, or use protocols that the radio itself is incapable of. There are mainly two standard-ish sizes:


  * JR - Also often called Full-size/Micro, being the older standard. It's physically larger, so there's more room to fit better cooling for high output powers, more features like an external screen, and other things that may be space-restrained

  * Lite - Also called Nano, first introduced by the FrSky X-Lite radio, meant to be a more compact option for smaller radios. Less available options and the smaller space makes for fewer available features
