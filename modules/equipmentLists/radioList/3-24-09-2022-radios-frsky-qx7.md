text: I'm putting these here for a few reasons. It is hands down the cheapest
  way to get a full-size radio like this... if you buy it used. I've seen it go
  for as low as $50-60 used, and for that price it works well. There are some
  drawbacks tho. Needs to be flashed to EdgeTX to run full baud rate, and even
  then it's limited to 500Hz
price: $40+
