text: If you want a small radio with top-end specs, this is the one to go with.
  Integrated crossfire for long range, and a large built-in battery. TBS make
  good quality stuff, and if you're already in the Crossfire ecosystem, it's a
  great radio. But if you don't have any Crossfire equipment, I'd consider
  adding an ELRS module going forward
