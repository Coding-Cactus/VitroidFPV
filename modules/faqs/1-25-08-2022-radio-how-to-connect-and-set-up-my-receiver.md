  1. (This step can be skipped if you have a receiver that can be flashed
  wirelessly as it can be changed after soldering it up) Make sure that the
  receiver is on matching firmware versions with the radio, most important to
  FrSky.﻿

      * They have ACCST V1/V2 FCC/LBT firmware, and ACCESS V2.0 / V2.1 to worry about. Make sure that the receiver and radio are running compatible versions.

      * ACCST V1 receiver firmware only works with ACCST V1 firmware radios , and you have to match FCC / LBT as well

      * ACCST V2 and ACCESS firmware receivers work with ACCST V2 / ACCESS radios (with the exception that the ACCESS versions also have to match)

      * Yes this is a mess﻿
  ﻿

      * Yes this is a very easily avoidable and more importantly easily fixable issue

      * Yes this is 100 % FrSky's fault

      * No they have not done much to address it

      * This is why we no longer recommend them﻿
