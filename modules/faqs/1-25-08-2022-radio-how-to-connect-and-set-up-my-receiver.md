  As briefly touched on in the **Electrical Compatibility** answer, all you
  really need is a spare UART port, and a fair bit of setting up


  1. Connect the receiver to the FC as instructed by the FC or receiver manufacturer.
    + ELRS, TBS Receivers, and most of the other high-performance systems use a full UART, meaning you just need a TX and an RX pad of the same number. 
    + FrSky uses a single **inverted** RX pad for their SBUS signal (needs hardware inversion on F4 FCs, F7 can be changed in config)
