title: Caffeine

It's well-known that developers require a certain percentage of caffeine in the bloodstream to function properly.

While that may be a slight exaggeration, caffeine does help me develop this site. You can support me by buying me a coffee.

(This is totally just a witty way to include direct donation links. I don't actually function purely on coffee)

Annoyingly I am not yet old enough to get access to most of these platforms. Commit coming in 2 months.
