Affiliate links... I decided to never use affiliate links in the build guides. Some people hate them or find them annoying, and I don't want someone buying something they don't need just because I want a quick commission. I would never recommend something I don't believe in or use myself. However, I do have some here if you want to support me and the further development of this site, and it won't cost you anything:
